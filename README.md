## Cloning the Repository

To get started with the **MyFineTracker** project, follow these steps to clone the repository to your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kirollos98/MyFineTracker.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd MyFineTracker
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the necessary packages using **npm** or **Yarn**:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install

   # OR using Yarn
   yarn install
   ```

> **Note**: Ensure you have [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) completed for your target platform(s) before proceeding.

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions until the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that comes with React Native.

From the **root** of your React Native project, run:

```bash
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start Your Application

With Metro Bundler running in its **own** terminal, open a **new** terminal window and navigate to the **root** of your project. Then, execute the following commands based on your target platform.

#### For Android

Ensure you have an Android emulator running or an Android device connected.

```bash
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

Ensure you have an iOS simulator running or an iOS device connected (macOS only).

```bash
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

> **Note**: If everything is set up correctly, your app should launch in the Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly. You can also run the app directly from **Android Studio** or **Xcode** respectively.

### Step 3: Modifying Your App

Now that your app is running, you can start customizing it.

1. **Open `App.tsx`**

   Use your preferred text editor or IDE to open the `App.tsx` file and make your desired changes.

2. **Reload the App to See Changes**

   - **For Android**:
     - Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice.
     - **OR** select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu**:
       - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux)
       - <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS)

   - **For iOS**:
     - Press <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in the iOS Simulator.

Your changes should now be visible in the running app!
